                Dragon Ball (Japanese: ドラゴンボール, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru) is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira
                Toriyama in 1984. The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in Weekly
                Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 tankōbon volumes by
                its publisher Shueisha. Dragon Ball was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel Journey to the
                West, as well as Hong Kong martial arts films.
            </p>
            <p>The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, Son
                Goku, from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far
                from civilization until he meets a teen girl named Bulma, who encourages him to join her quest in
                exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting
                dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man,
                discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon
                Balls.

                    <p> Son Goku, born Kakarot(Kakarotto), is the main protagonist of
                        the Dragon Ball metaseries. Goku is a Saiyan originally sent to destroy Earth as an infant.
                        However, a head injury at an early age alters his memory, ridding him of his initial destructive
                        nature and allowing him to grow up to become one of Earth's greatest defenders. He constantly
                        strives and trains to be the greatest warrior possible, which has kept the Earth and
                        the universe safe from destruction many times.

                    <p>
                        Goku was named Kakarot at birth. In the manga, Kakarot was born on Planet Vegeta three years
                        before its destruction, while in the anime Goku was born shortly before the destruction of the
                        planet. When Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, Goku survived as he was being sent to Earth.

                        and live on Earth. His character evolves from villain, to anti-hero, then to hero through the
                        course of the series, repeatedly fighting alongside the universe's most powerful warriors in
                        order to protect his new home and surpass Goku in power.
