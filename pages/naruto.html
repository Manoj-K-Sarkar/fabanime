                Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story
                of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks to gain recognition from his peers and also dreams of
                becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is in two parts, the first set in Naruto's
                pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto:
                Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the
                following year, and Naruto (1997).
            </p>

                Naruto is the fourth best-selling manga series in history, selling 250 million copies worldwide in 46
                countries.[3] It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of
                the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the
                seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006.

                        Naruto Uzumaki is a fictional character in the anime and manga Naruto, created by Masashi
                        Kishimoto. Serving as the eponymous
                        protagonist of the series, he is a young ninja from the fictional village of Konohagakure.

                    <p>
                        The villagers ridicule Naruto on account of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a malevolent creature that
                        attacked Konohagakure—that was sealed away in Naruto's body. Despite this, he aspires to become
                        his village's leader, the Hokage. His carefree, optimistic and boisterous personality enables
                        him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages.

                        loyalty to his friends and students becomes increasingly apparent. Kakashi's past has been
                        extensively explored in the series, resulting in a gaiden being devoted to his past experiences.
